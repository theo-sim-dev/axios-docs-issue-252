# axios-docs-issue-252

This repository includes two JavaScript files to verify the features reported in [axios-docs issue #252](https://github.com/axios/axios-docs/issues/252). These files are intended to test and demonstrate the features for the related documentation pull request (https://github.com/axios/axios-docs/pull/254).

## Verification

Basic verification to see if the reported feature is actually available on `Axios`:

```
npm i
npm run start
```

To test the error-handling examples using this feature from `Axios`, then:

```
npm run error-handling
```
